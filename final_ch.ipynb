    "The data was obtained from Open Data DC site at https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crime-incidents-in-2010 through https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crime-incidents-in-2019. \n",
    "Spreadsheets were downloaded from the site and combined into one spreadsheet for ten years of data from 2010 to 2019.\n",
    "Approximately 33,000 to 38,000 entities/observations were obtained from each year, totalling approximately 350,000 observation in total (349,343 to be exact).<BR><BR>\n",
    "In data science, when we want to extract desired data from a website, we usually get more than what we needed. We may get useless data or garabage data that we won't need. To get around this, we tidy our data to make a cleaner dataset for us to work with. There are a few ways to tidy our data: Gathering (eliminate the column headers with values and replace with variable name), splitting (separate the multiple variables stored in one column), rotating (when there are variables storied both in rows and column), normalizing (separating multiple types of obersavtional units that are stored in the same table into multiple different tables), and joining (combining multiple datasets based on a condition into one dataset).<BR><BR>\n",
    "In our tutorial, we tidy our trained data (2010-2019) by dropping any unnecessary columns of data, leaving only the latitude as X, longitude as Y (the coordinates to where the crime was reported), report date (date the police officer recorded the report), start date (the date the crime started), end date (date the crime supposedly ended), and offense (theft from auto).<BR><BR>\n",
    "We then dropped any entities/observations with missing data in any fields. We converted any date/time fields to datetime objects in python. Examples and usage can be found at <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html\">https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html</a> and <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/gal-a/blog/blob/master/docs/notebooks/pandas/pandas_datetime.ipynb\">https://colab.research.google.com/github/gal-a/blog/blob/master/docs/notebooks/pandas/pandas_datetime.ipynb</a>.\n",

    "<BR>\n",
    "    <strong>Further tidying:</strong> Since we identified that we still have some unrelated data, we could either remove it from our dataset, or filter it out to ignore it. We chose to filter it out later on ie. during out Prediction task to generate a table for totals for each year, and use that as our training data for Machine Learning. Since report dates would report crime that did not necessarily start in the same year it was reported, we can filter out the data many different ways. <i>It is important to document the method that was used so that <strong>reproducibility</strong> can occur.</i> Since we know that very few reported crimes did not start the same year it was reported, we ignore entities/observations that do not match a start date between years 2010-2019, by filtering for year 2010 start date.<BR><BR>\n",

    "<strong>Description:</strong> (Above) This bar plot alternatively can be used to show other aspects of the data in a easy to interpret form. One idea that can be used is whether or not crime should be exhibited in a standardized format. For example, using the percent of TFA per year may be a way to standardize the data, since not every year will have the same amount of crime. This bar graph clearly shows there is a peak in crime in 2014.<BR><BR>The barplot above indicates the frequency of theft from cars from the years 2010-2019.<BR>\n",
    "Based on our observations, the barplot shows some kind of positive relationship between time and the number of thefts from auto. As the years go by, the number of auto theft tends to increase."

    "<strong>Y-Axis:</strong> Amount of TFA<BR>\n",
    "<strong>Description:</strong> (Above) This bar plot instead shows the number of TFA per year, instead of the percentage of TFA. Interpretations can easily be drawn from visuals such as bar graphs, scatterplots, histograms, violin plots, boxplots, and more. From this bar graph, we can see that the number of theft from auto is not always increasing each year. This may make it more difficult to predict. Also, keep in mind that police departments, are also aware of increasing trends, and may be proactive in running awareness campaigns to curb TFA. This could account for some of the decreases in TFA as seen in 2017 and 2019."

In data science, we call this “line of regression” or the “linear fit” as we regress X-variable on Y-variable. We will use a linear regression model to determine and predict the relationship between years from the crime dataset and the number of auto theft cases reported in those years. "
